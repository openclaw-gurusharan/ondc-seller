# TEMPLATE: mark-feature-complete.sh
#
# Purpose: Update feature-list.json with new feature status
#
# CUSTOMIZE THIS for your project:
# - Adjust feature-list format if different
# - Add validation (check feature exists before updating)
# - Support different status values (pending, in_progress, implemented, tested, blocked)
#
# Usage: ./mark-feature-complete.sh <feature-id> [status]
# Example: ./mark-feature-complete.sh feat-001 implemented
